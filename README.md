## Iris Dispatcher

Iris is a data logging program that receives and decodes Short-Burst data packets from Iridium modems via NAL Research Corp.
The program consists of a react app made using Create-React-App for frontend and an express.js server for backend.

Iris is designed to phase out the use of third-party programs to assist with the data saving process and generally clean up the
information flow.
